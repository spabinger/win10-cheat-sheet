# Win10 Cheat-sheet

## Shortcuts

#### General
* Windows+A: Open the Action Center.
* Windows+I: Open Windows Settings.
* Windows+S: Open Cortana.
* Windows+C: Open Cortana in listening mode.

#### Window Snapping Shortcuts

* Windows+Left: Snap current window to the left side of the screen.
* Windows+Right: Snap current window the the right side of the screen.
* Windows+Up: Snap current window to the top of the screen.
* Windows+Down: Snap current window to the bottom of the screen.

#### Task View and Window Management Shortcuts

* Windows+Tab: This opens the new Task View interface, and it stays open—you can release the keys. Only windows from your current virtual desktop appear in the Task View list, and you can use the virtual desktop switcher at the bottom of the screen to switch between virtual desktops.
* Alt+Tab: This isn’t a new keyboard shortcut, and it works just like you’d expect it to. Pressing Alt+Tab lets you switch between your open Windows. With the Alt key still pressed, tap Tab again to flip between windows, and then release the Alt key to select the current window. Alt+Tab now uses the new Task View-style larger thumbnails. Unlike Windows+Tab, Alt+Tab lets you switch between open windows on all virtual desktops.
* Ctrl+Alt+Tab: This works the same as Alt+Tab, but you don’t have to hold down the Alt key—the window thumbnails stay on screen when you release all the keys. Use Tab or your arrow keys to move between thumbnails. Press Enter to select the current thumbnail and make that window active.

#### Virtual Desktop Shortcuts
* Windows+Ctrl+D: Create a new virtual desktop and switch to it
* Windows+Ctrl+F4: Close the current virtual desktop.
* Windows+Ctrl+Left/Right: Switch to the virtual desktop on the left or right.

#### Command Prompt Shortcuts
* Ctrl+V or Shift+Insert: Pastes text at the cursor.
* Ctrl+C or Ctrl+Insert: Copies the selected text to the clipboard.

#### Shortcuts for Selecting Text at the Command Prompt
* Ctrl+A: Select all text in the current line if the line contains text. If it’s an empty line, select all text in the Command Prompt.
* Shift+Left/Right/Up/Down: Moves the cursor left a character, right a character, up a line, or down a line, selecting the text along the way. Continue pressing arrow keys to select more text.
* Ctrl+Shift+Left/Right: Moves the cursor one word to the left or right, selecting that word along the way.
* Shift+Home/End: Moves the cursor to the beginning or end of the current line, selecting text along the way.
* Shift+Page Up/Page Down: Moves the cursor up or down a screen, selecting text.
* Ctrl+Shift+Home/End: Moves the cursor to the beginning or end of the “screen buffer,” selecting all text between the cursor and the beginning or end of the Command Prompt’s output.
* Ctrl-f-to-search-in-command-prompt-on-windows-10

#### More Command Prompt Shortcuts
* Ctrl+Up/Down: Moves one line up or down in the Command Prompt’s history — it’s like using the scroll bar.
* Ctrl+Page Up/Page Down: Moves one page up or down in the Command Prompt’s history — it’s like scrolling even farther.
* Ctrl+M: Enter “mark mode,” which helps for selecting text. Previously, the only way to do this was by right-clicking in the Command Prompt and selecting Mark. Thanks to the new Shift key shortcuts, this mode is no longer as important.
* Ctrl+F: Opens a Find dialog for searching the Command Prompt’s output.
* Alt+F4: Closes the Command Prompt window.
